# Chess Engine

### Motivation

I decided to build a chess engine because I've always enjoyed playing chess and recently watched a video explaining how chess engines work. The concepts were intriguing and motivated me to try building one myself.

### Why C++

C++ is a widely used language in graphics, libraries, operating systems, and embedded development. Although I’m still learning it, I think it’s a neat and challenging language that’s perfect for a project like this.

### Project overview

This project aims to implement a functional chess engine in C++. The codebase is organized into modules for the board, pieces, players, and utility functions. My goal is to deepen my understanding of search algorithms (e.g., alpha-beta pruning), efficient low-level programming techniques such as bitwise operations, and C++ programming in general.
